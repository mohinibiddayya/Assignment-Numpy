    "vectorization refers to the ability to perform operations on entire arrays (or large chunks of data) at once, rather than using explicit loops to iterate over individual elements. This takes advantage of NumPy's underlying optimizations, which leverage low-level implementations (like C and Fortran) to execute operations in a highly efficient manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "* Performance Improvement: Vectorized operations can be significantly faster than their loop-based counterparts because they minimize the overhead of Python's interpreted loops.\n",
    "* Cleaner Code: Vectorization leads to more concise and readable code, making it easier to understand and maintain. \n",
    "Broadcasting\n",
    "Definition: Broadcasting is a technique that allows NumPy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes. When operating on two arrays, NumPy will automatically \"stretch\" the smaller array across the larger one so that they have compatible shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it Works:\n",
    "Shape Compatibility: Two arrays are compatible for broadcasting if:\n",
    "They have the same number of dimensions.\n",
    "The size of each dimension is either the same or one of them is 1.\n",
    "Stretching: The smaller array is virtually expanded to match the shape of the larger array during the operation.\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "Flexibility: Broadcasting allows for operations on arrays of different shapes without requiring explicit reshaping or tiling of data.\n",
